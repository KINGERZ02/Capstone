# Capstone Project: Vitals & Clinical Notes Modeling 🩺📊

## 🔹 Project Overview
This project focuses on developing two machine learning models:
1. **Vitals Model** – Predictive modeling using patient vitals data.  
2. **Clinical Notes Model** – Natural Language Processing (NLP) on clinical notes.  

The goal is to combine structured and unstructured healthcare data to enhance predictive healthcare insights.

## 👥 Team Members & Roles
- **Ketan Barkade** – Vitals Model (ML backend, feature engineering)  
- **Ethan** – Clinical Notes Model (ML backend, NLP pipeline)  
- **Yugs** – UI/UX design & Research paper writing

## ❓ Problem Statement
Healthcare data is heterogeneous, consisting of structured vital signs and unstructured clinical notes. 
The challenge is to build robust ML models that can learn from both modalities to assist in early disease prediction and patient monitoring.
